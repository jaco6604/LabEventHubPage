                <h3>Invention of the Turing Machine</h3>
                <p>The Turing machine was invented by Alan Turing in 1936 when he published a paper titled "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem". This theoretical model, initially called an "a-machine" by Turing, was designed to answer a fundamental question in mathematics and laid the groundwork for the universal digital computer that we know today.

                <p>The Turing test was invented by English computer scientist and mathematician Alan Turing in 1950. He first proposed the "imitation game," which evolved into the Turing test, in his landmark 1950 paper titled "Computing Machinery and Intelligence".</p>
